# Water Pump Functionality Project: Sprint Tasks and Tickets

## Required Individual Setup Tasks

Before diving into the sprint-specific tasks, each team member must complete these individual setup tasks:

### Required Setup Tasks (Each Team Member Must Complete)
- **Clone the GitHub repository**: Everyone needs their own local copy of the project to contribute effectively.
- **Set up your development environment**: Install required Python packages (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, geopandas, etc.) and configure your IDE.
- **Test your environment**: Run the provided starter code to ensure everything works properly.
- **Familiarize yourself with the dataset**: Review the feature descriptions and understand the structure of the training and testing data.
- **Set up Git workflow**: Configure your Git identity and understand the branch/commit strategy for collaboration.

These foundational tasks ensure everyone has the necessary tools and understanding to contribute to the project. After completing these individual setup tasks, the team can distribute the sprint-specific tasks based on skills, interests, and learning goals.

## Task Distribution Guidelines
- **Align with strengths**: Assign tasks based on team members' existing skills when possible
- **Support learning goals**: Allow members to take on tasks in areas where they want to develop new skills
- **Balance workload**: Distribute tasks evenly, considering complexity and time requirements
- **Consider dependencies**: Identify which tasks depend on others to plan work sequentially
- **Document ownership**: Clearly record who is responsible for each ticket
- **Encourage collaboration**: While tickets have owners, encourage helping each other when needed

## Individual vs. Team Responsibility

Throughout the project, tasks can be categorized as:

### Required Individual Tasks (Everyone Must Complete)
- Setting up local development environment
- Cloning/forking repository and configuring Git
- Reviewing dataset and documentation
- Understanding the problem statement and project goals
- Contributing to code reviews
- Participating in team meetings and sprint reviews

### Team-Distributed Tasks (Assign Based on Skills/Interests)
- Specific tickets from each sprint can be distributed among team members
- Some complex tickets may benefit from pair programming
- Consider assigning roles based on strengths (e.g., data preprocessing, modeling, visualization)
- Ensure everyone gets exposure to different aspects of the data science workflow

Remember that while certain tickets are assigned to individuals, the entire team should understand the overall project flow and be able to discuss results collaboratively during review sessions.

## Sprint Review Guidance

At the end of each sprint:
1. Review completed deliverables against acceptance criteria
2. Document what went well and what could be improved
3. Identify any challenges encountered and how they were overcome
4. Prepare for the sprint presentation
5. Plan for the next sprint based on learnings from the current sprint
