# HydroLogic
A machine learning project to predict the functionality status of water pumps across Tanzania based on a variety of features including location, water quality, management structure, and technical specifications. It addresses a critical infrastructure challenge: identifying which water pumps are functional, need repairs, and are non-functional.

# Introduction
Access to clean and reliable water is fundamental to public health and socio-economic development. In Tanzania, ensuring sustainable water supply and sanitation services is a priority aligned with global initiatives like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 6, which emphasizes the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. The Ministry of Water has developed comprehensive guidelines, such as the Design, Construction, Supervision, Operation, and Maintenance (DCOM) manual, to support the planning and implementation of water supply projects across the country. 

# Problem Statement
Despite significant efforts, many communities in Tanzania still face challenges with non-functional or partially functional water pumps, leading to inconsistent access to clean water. Factors contributing to this issue include inadequate maintenance, environmental conditions, and technical failures. Addressing these challenges requires a systematic approach to predict and monitor water pump functionality, enabling timely interventions and resource allocation.

# Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop machine learning models capable of predicting the functionality status of water pumps across Tanzania. By analyzing various factors such as location, water quality, management structures, and technical specifications, the project aims to identify which pumps are functional, which require repairs, and which are non-functional. This predictive capability will enhance maintenance operations, ensure better resource distribution, and ultimately improve access to clean water for communities.
